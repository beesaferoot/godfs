# goSimDFS
Distributed File System Client Simulator 

## Design Architecture Guide 
This implementation is based on the research paper [DFS_simulation_14m.pdf](http://www.cse.scu.edu/~mwang2/projects/DFS_simulation_14m.pdf "A simulation of distributed file system" )

## Implementation differences 
While the design is based on the above paper, this implementation leverages concurrency benefits in the [go programming language](https://tour.golang.org/list).

## TODO 
* client usuage should be described here

## Contributions
- are you interested in distributed systems? 
- or what to learn about file systems? 
Contributions are welcomed, hope to expand on this project.
